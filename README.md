App 05 
Programming with Multiple Methods 
 
App 05 is “task oriented”.  It tells you exactly what your program should produce. 
You will practice this skill in every App from this App forward.

Encapsulation is one of the basic premises of programming.  Encapsulation allows us to reuse parts of programs that provide specific functionality.  Methods are one form of encapsulation. 
 
The purpose of this App is for you to practicing encapsulating functionality in methods. 
 
Requirements: 
1. In a single java program in eclipse 
A.	Add thirteen methods based on the following requirements .  Methods require proper parameters and return types. 
a.	One method should ask for and return the user’s name 
b.	One method should display the name that is passed to it with appropriate labeling, so I know what it is. 
c.	One method should ask for and return the user’s favorite number. 
d.	One method should display the number that is passed to it with appropriate labeling. 
e.	One method should ask and return an integer 
f.	One method should display 5 integers with appropriate labels. 
g.	One method should average 5 integers and return the average with an appropriate label. 
h.	One method should ask for and return the user’s favorite color. 
i.	One method should tell the user the color passed to it with appropriate labels. 
j.	One method should ask for and return the user’s age. 
k.	One method should ask for and return the age the user wishes they were. 
l.	One method should calculate and return the difference between the two ages with appropriate labels.   
 
B.	Add code to your constructor that: 
a.	Calls the methods that will find out the user’s name and stores the returned value in a variable. 
b.	Calls the method that displays the name. 
c.	Calls the method to find out what the user’s favorite number is and stores the returned value in a variable.  
d.	Calls the method that displays the user’s favorite number. 
e.	Calls the method that asks the user to input an integer 5 times and stores each returned value in a variable. 
f.	Calls the method that displays those numbers. 
g.	Calls the method that displays the average of those five numbers. 
h.	Calls the method that determines the user’s favorite color 
i.	Calls the method that displays that color. 
j.	Calls the method that asks the user’s age. 
k.	Calls the method that asks what age the user would like to be. 
l.	Calls the method that displays the difference between the two ages.
